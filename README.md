## **Preliminary information on Voi’s governance program, its purpose, and what to expect**

### **Welcome to Voi’s governance program!**

Voi’s governance program puts you as a member of our community in charge of the future of Voi. Whether you are a developer, node-runner, application owner, or entrepreneur, your contributions to our network are what will allow Voi to bring blockchain to communities around the world and actualize our mission of building a blockchain for mainstream users.

In this repository you will find files providing information on Voi’s testnet (to launch October 2nd), how the governance and granting process will work throughout testnet and mainnet, the current bounty board, the grant application form, and the testnet committee’s process for evaluating submissions. 

We are excited for you to get involved and working on real projects that will help bring Voi to fruition! Please feel free to provide our team with any and all feedback as you navigate through Voi’s Github, begin partaking in bounties and other activities that will help us secure the network, prepare for testnet launch and even thereafter.  

## **Introduction to Voi’s testnet**  
### **General information on Voi’s multi-phase testnet.**
Voi’s testnet is anticipated to launch October 2nd. Our major goal for Testnet is to onboard node runners and applications. Voi’s testnet will serve as a sandbox environment, replicating the conditions of our mainnet. It will provide our community of Voiagers - node runners, application developers, and power users - with a firsthand experience of the Voi Network and allow us to develop the infrastructure and application offering to prepare for mainnet. 

Voi’s testnet will have 3 consecutive stages each spanning a couple of months to get different aspects of Voi’s infrastructure up and running: 

1.Node network development
2.NFT infrastructure
3.DeFi infrastructure
(NFT and DeFI stages may be swapped) 

We aim to achieve a substantial user base in order to have a vibrant and active testnet environment. This is crucial for testing the network's capabilities and gathering valuable feedback. To facilitate this, we will be running a Testnet Incentive Bounty Board that will follow the same Voi’s general governance structure as outlined in this main repository and all the files and documents found within. 

## **How it works**
### **Describes the grant issuance process, review cycle, and expectations around submission.** 

To start, during Voi’s testnet phase and perhaps thereafter, governance will function on a monthly cycle. Proposals to receive testnet token grants can be submitted on a rolling basis and will be reviewed by the testnet committee on a rolling basis. More information on Voi’s testnet and the underworkings of this testnet committee can be found in this living document. 

The general submission and review process is as follows: 

**1. Bounty Board:** _On a monthly basis the committee will update the Bounty Board, which will act as a call for proposals that are available for testnet grants. The post for proposals will highlight Voi’s main priorities for the upcoming quarter and will be updated monthly if not sooner on the Bounty Board._

**2. Proposal Submission:** _Proposals can be submitted on a rolling basis. All proposals must be submitted using the Proposal Submission Template on Github and be submitted with all sections completed._

**3. Review of Applications:** _Proposals will be viewable and commentable by the greater Voi community for 7-days post submission. Each member of the Testnet Committee will then review and evaluate each grant application in accordance with the Proposal Evaluation Form. Committee members will convene to discuss the reasons for their scores in each criteria. Committee members assigned scores for each criteria will be averaged to get a final score on each criteria. A total score is determined by tallying up the final criteria scores and by applying a weight to each criteria based on the vertical that the project falls in. If the ultimate score of the application is above the necessary threshold then the application proceeds._

**4. Scoring, Ranking & Decision-Making:** _Committee members are responsible for scoring and ranking each submission against each other based on predetermined criteria shared in the call for proposals. The committee is responsible for collaboratively determining which proposals will receive testnet tokens and how much using the TestNet Incentive Bounty Token Allocation board as a guide._

**5. Sponsorship & Advocacy:** _Each submitted proposal will require a sponsor on the committee that voluntarily chooses to support the team/individual requesting funding. This committee member will get to know the project and team better and vouch for the value of their project for the network. If ultimately selected for a grant, the sponsor will manage and sign off on any milestones the project has._ 

Voi's founding team of core contributors will transparently communicate with all applicants, notifying them of selection outcomes, providing feedback, and clarifying any questions they may have about the decision process in a timely manner (within 30-days of proposal submission). 

The Committee will regularly assess the selection process's effectiveness, identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes that enhance the fairness, efficiency, and transparency of the process while soliciting feedback from applicants on their experience with the process.
