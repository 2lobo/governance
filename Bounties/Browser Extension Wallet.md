# Browser Extension Wallet

Testnet Token Bounty Size: **75MM to 125MM**

## Description

Extension based wallet that works on chrome for Voi Network.

Examples include Metamask or Algosigner. 

An opensourced project already worked on by a community members can be used as [starting point](https://github.com/VoiNetwork/voila.money).
