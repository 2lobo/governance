# Decentralized Oracle

Testnet Token Bounty Size: **150MM to 250MM**

## Description

We need to bring off chain data on chain via decentralized oracles

### What

A decentralized oracle provider is needed within the ecosystem

### Why

We need a service in the ecosystem to enable off-chain data to be brough on-chain data so that it can be used by smart contracts and other applications

## Problem Statement

To build a decentralized oracle service

## Minimum Requirements




## Definition of Done

- Successfully implemented the minimum features as per the minimum requirements
- 99.99% uptime for the duration of testnet
- All code open sourced
