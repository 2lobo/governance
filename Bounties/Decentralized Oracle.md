# Decentralized Oracle

Testnet Token Bounty Size: **150MM to 250MM**

## Description

We need to bring off chain data on chain via decentralized oracles

### What

A decentralized oracle provider is needed within the ecosystem, this could bring in pricing data of assets or even the weather of local areas for example.

### Why

We need a service in the ecosystem to enable off-chain data to be brough on-chain data so that it can be used by smart contracts and other applications that may depend on such data to provide their services and value to end users

## Problem Statement

To build a decentralized oracle service that can provide generic data feeds that add value to the ecosystem.

## Minimum Requirements

1. Ability to be able to read from the oracle the necessary data once it is on-chain
2. web app for users to be able to browse the different feeds provided by the oracle
3. Data being brought on chain must be from multiple sources where possible
4. Built in a modular and extensible way such that it would be easy to add in new types of data to be brought on-chain

## Definition of Done

- Successfully implemented the minimum features as per the minimum requirements
- 99.99% uptime for the duration of testnet
- All code open sourced
