# **Proposal Evaluation Form**
**Outlines how grants will be reviewed and evaluated by Voi's governance committee.**

A copy of the committee evaluation template can be found in the table below for reference. **Please only submit the Google Form version of this evaluation that has been provided by the core team.** This has been provided for the sake of transparency and to support those seeking funding with the development of a successful proposal. 

The following process will be followed by the proposal committee when evaluating and scoring proposals: 

1. Each committee assigns scores out of 5 in each of the categories.
2. Committee members will convene to discuss the reasons for their scores in each criteria.
3. Committee members assigned scores for each criteria will be averaged to get a final score on each criteria.
4. A total score is determined by tallying up the final criteria scores and by converting it to a percentage.
5. If the ultimate score of the application is above the necessary threshold of 70% to be determined by the committee then the application proceeds.
