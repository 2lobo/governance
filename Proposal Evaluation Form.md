# **Proposal Evaluation Form**
** Outlines how grants will be reviewed and evaluated by Voi's governance committee.**

A copy of the committee evaluation template can be found in the table below for reference. This has been provided for the sake of transparency and to support those seeking funding with the development of a successful proposal. 

The following process will be followed by the proposal committee when evaluating and scoring proposals: 

1. Each committee assigns scores out of 10 in each of the categories.
2. Committee members will convene to discuss the reasons for their scores in each criteria.
3. Committee members assigned scores for each criteria will be averaged to get a final score on each criteria.
4. A total score is determined by tallying up the final criteria scores and by applying a weight to each criteria.
5. If the ultimate score of the application is above the necessary threshold to be determined by the committee then the application proceeds.
